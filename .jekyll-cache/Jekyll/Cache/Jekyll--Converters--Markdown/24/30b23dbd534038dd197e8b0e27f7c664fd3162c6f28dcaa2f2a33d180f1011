I"m<p>This whole website is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> and theme <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/"><strong>minimal-mistakes</strong></a>. 
I had no experience of HTML or CSS language, but still managed to get the website to work. Thatâ€™s just how easy it is to work with <strong>Jekyll</strong>.</p>
