## Tricks to Improve your Random Forests

<!-- ![Trees](/assets/images/mountains.jpg) -->

**Inspiration**: [Jeremy Howard fastai Course](http://course18.fast.ai/lessonsml1/lessonsml1.html)

> Whether you need to classify an object or predict a continues outcome or even a cluster unsupervised data Random Forests offers you a base line model to test your results sometimes even a better one than the most popular algorithm.

With some of the perks including:

- Parallelization
- Robustness
- Easy to Understand
- No need to assume anything about the data.
- Doesn't overfit usually.
- Gives estimate of important varibales.
- No need for cross validation.

##### Algorithms such as **XGBoost**  **Random Forests** helped many to land top on the winner boards in many machine learning competitions.

Forest is nothing but a piece of land with many trees, which is same as a rondom forest which is nothing but a combination of many desicion trees. A slight analogy of differences between a crop and a forest can used to describe a good random forest model, i.e a good random forest is defined as the one with multiple trees which has less correlation between them.

â€‹                                                     **Here is the original paper on [Random Forests](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf)**

> ***You have fitted your data and claluclated the R^2 score of your model and got 0.75 what to do next to increase it to 0.98*** 

Let's write some helper functions that are useful in the process All the values you see below is for [iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) dataset

```python
# Import Libraries
from fastai.imports import *
from fastai.structured import *
from IPython.display import display
from sklearn import metrics

# Load Dataset
from sklearn import datasets
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data 
y = iris.target

# Split Data
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size = 0.2, stratify = y)

# Load Model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Metrics Functions
def rmse(x,y): return math.sqrt(((x-y)**2).mean())

def print_score(m):
  """
  Returns: rmse of train, rmse of test, r^2 of train, r^2 of test and oob_score(if given)
  """
    res = [rmse(m.predict(x_train), y_train), rmse(m.predict(x_test), y_test),
                m.score(x_train, y_train), m.score(x_test, y_test)]
    if hasattr(m, 'oob_score_'): res.append(m.oob_score_)
    print(res)
```

### Tip 1:  Grow all the trees at the same time:

Random Forest models are very fast to train because of their parallelization across all the avaiable cores either in your CPU using 

`n_jobs`.

```python
# parallelize your Model
rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_jobs = -1)

n_jobs = -1 # Uses all the cores of your CPU
n_jobs = 1 # Uses 1 core in your cpu
n_jobs = 2 # Uses 2 cores in your cpu etc.
```

### Tip 2: Divide the tree into groups to help them grow fast:

Random forests works perfectly even if you have billions of rows if you have enough resource and processing power **OR** you can break down data into subsets  -  ***SUB SAMPLING***

```python
# If you are using fastai library split_vals can be used to split data into subsets 
size = int # required size
X_train, _ = split_vals(df_trn, size) 
y_train, _ = split_vals(y_trn, size)

# set model samples
set_rf_samples(size)
```

You can also `Bootstrap`  parameter to choose the samples from data

`True` : Draws a subset sample size from the data with replacement

`False` : Let's you sample whole data for every tree while you the randomizes the columns that goes to the tree.

### Tip 3: Always use optimal number of trees for a better Forest:

Play with numbers of tree (`n_estimators`) until you get a good model or use [Grid Search](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) to find optimal parameters

```python
m = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10, n_jobs=-1)
m.fit(x_train, y_train)
print_score(m)
# [0.09128709291752768, 0.18257418583505536, 0.9916666666666667, 0.9666666666666667]

m = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=20, n_jobs=-1)
m.fit(x_train, y_train)
print_score(m)
# [0.12909944487358055, 0.18257418583505536, 0.9833333333333333, 0.9666666666666667]

m = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=40, n_jobs=-1)
m.fit(x_train, y_train)
print_score(m)
# [0.0, 0.18257418583505536, 1.0, 0.9666666666666667]
```

**Bagging** : Combination of weak trees makes a forest a better classifier.

Plot the graph of tree vs score to get a better idea to select the number of estimators:

![Bagging](/assets/images/RandomForest/Bagging.png)

You will get a certain number where your score doesn't get better, It good to stop there and experiment with other parameters.

### Tip 4: What if new trees as not growing as good as old ones:

If your validation score is worse than training score their is a better way to check it rather than checking on validation data.

While implementing a random forest tree each tree uses only ceratin amount of data randomly to form a tree later we can use the remaining data to check if our model overfits or not this method by setting `oob_score` parameter to `True` in the model .

```python
m = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=40, n_jobs=-1, oob_score=True)
m.fit(x_train, y_train)
print_score(m)
# [0.0, 0.18257418583505536, 1.0, 0.9666666666666667, 0.95]
```

Here the oob_score is 0.95 while train_score is 0.1 while tells that data didn't overfit that much.

### Tip 5: Get the satellite veiw of your forest:

Its always a good way to visualize your forest model for better optimization, Todo that always use less estimators may be 1

```python
m = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=1, max_depth=3, bootstrap=False, n_jobs=-1)
m.fit(x_train, y_train)
print_score(m)

# Give representative Columns to your data.
x_train = pd.DataFrame(x_train, columns = ['sepal length', 'sepal width', 'petal length', 'petal width'])

# Draw_tree function in fastai let's you visualize the tree  
draw_tree(m.estimators_[0], x_train, precision=3)
```

![tree diagram](/assets/images/RandomForest/tree.png)

We can observe here that `sepal length` plays an important role in differentiating the data 

`gini` : represents the error score if you classify data with that particular set of labels until then.

`samples` : No:of samples in that group 

`value` : mean value of each class

### Tip 6: Less Branches makes the tree grow Tall 

Inorder to acheive this we will use:

`min_samples_leaf`  :  This will limit the number of leaf nodes in a tree which intern reduces overfitting and therefore predictions are made using more number of estimators reducing volatility of the model.

`max_features`  : Along with randomizing the data row-wise for each tree max_features limits the number of features for each tree ,which randomizes the model further and reduces bias.
